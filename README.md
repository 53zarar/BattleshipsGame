# Battleships Game ðŸš¢

This project is a battleships game where you play against an AI. 
There are five battleships of varying lengths.
You win the game by sinking all of the AI's battleships. 
Game is played on a website, and the backend is on Python, while the frontend is on Flask and HTML. 
 
## Installation

This application uses packages that may need to be installed
Python
install Flask
install pytest

Python version used: 3.10.2

## Usage

The four modules in this project are:
1. components.py, functions include initialise_board(), create_battleships() and place_battleships():
    - intialise_board(): Creates a board that is initially empty
    - create_battleships(): Creates a dictionary of battleships, loaded in from the battleships.txt file
    - place_battleships(): Places the battleships onto the board, and can be done with three different elements: simple, random, and custom
 
2. game_engine.py, functions include attack(), cli_coordinates_input() and simple_game_loop():
    - attack(): Processes the attack on a specific coordinate on the board
    - cli_coordinates_input(): Stores the users chosen x and y input for their attack
    - simple_game_loop(): Lets the user play without the AI opponent

3. mp_game_engine.py, functions include generate_attack() and ai_opponent_game_loop():
    - generate_attack(): Generates random coordinates which the AI uses for its attack
    - ai_opponent_game_loop(): Allows the user to play against the AI

4. main.py, functions include root, placement_interface, and process_attack:
    - root: Accessed by "/" is where the main page of the game is set up
    - placement_interface: Accessed by "/placement" is where the user is allowed to place their ships
    - process_attack: Accessed by a GET request to "/attack" where the user's input is handled for the subsequent attack

How to use the application on the web server:
1. Run the main.py file 
2. It will take you to 'http://127.0.0.1:5000', and show the main.html webpage
3. Add '/placement' giving you 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/placement'
4. Place the battleships and press the "Send Board" button
5. Play the game on the main page
6. The game will end if you win or lose

You can also play the game in mp_game_engine.py if you just run that module.
